# Petly Frontend
Welcome to Petly, a web application dedicated to pets, providing a platform for pet owners to connect, sell, and find pets in good hands. 

## About the Project
  Petly is a full-stack web application built with React on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend. The project is built using React and communicates with the Petly backend through RESTful API calls. The page is designed with a responsive layout, making it accessible to users on various devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Overall, the Petly Frontend project is a comprehensive platform for pet owners to connect, sell, and find pets in good hands, as well as access news and information about pet car. Users can browse through listings of pets available for adoption, as well as create their own listings to sell or give away pets. Additionally, users can add their own pets to their profiles, complete with information about their pet's breed, age, and other relevant details.

## Feature
1. User Authentication: The project allows users to create an account, log in, and log out. User authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are generated by the backend API and stored in the browser's local storage.

2. Pet Management: Once logged in, users can create and manage profiles for their pets. This includes adding information such as their name, breed, age, and weight, as well as setting reminders for feeding schedules, exercise routines, and medical appointments.

3. Notices: The project includes a feature that allows users to post notices about sell, lost/found and 'in good hands' pets. This feature is intended to help reunite lost pets with their owners as quickly as possible. Users can create a new notice, including a photo of the pet, a description, and contact information, and browse existing notices to see if any match their missing pet.

4. Responsive Design: The project is designed to be responsive, meaning that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This allows users to access the project from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
